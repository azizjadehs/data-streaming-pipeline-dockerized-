# ðŸ”¥ Real-Time Data Pipeline Project (Work In Progress)

Welcome to my real-time scalable data processing platform project! ðŸš€  
This project is designed to simulate and process streaming data using modern big data technologies.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
- **Apache Kafka** for real-time data ingestion
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** for real-time data processing
- **Docker + Docker Compose** for containerization
- (Upcoming) **PostgreSQL / MongoDB** for data storage
- (Upcoming) **FastAPI** for building APIs and serving analytics
- (Upcoming) **Dashboards** for visualization (ReactJS / Plotly / Grafana)

---

## ðŸ”„ Current Progress
- âœ… Kafka and Spark integrated and running inside Docker
- âœ… Real-time message simulation (currently using test data)
- âœ… In progress: Connecting real Steam reviews to Kafka
- ðŸ›  Current work: Saving data into Postgresql Data base

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Simulate real-world real-time data (e.g., Steam game reviews).
- Process the stream to extract meaningful insights.
- Store processed data in efficient databases.
- Provide easy access to the data via APIs and dashboards.
